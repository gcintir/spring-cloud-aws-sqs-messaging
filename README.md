# 🛠️ Mastering AWS SQS Integration with Spring Cloud AWS: Hands-On Examples and Testcontainers-Powered Testing

Welcome to the **Spring Cloud AWS SQS Integration** project! This repository demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate **Amazon SQS** with **Spring Boot** using **Spring Cloud AWS**. We explore practical messaging scenarios and ensure reliability through **Testcontainers**-powered integration tests and **LocalStack** for local simulation.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Simplified SQS Integration**: Leverage abstractions like `SqsTemplate` and `@SqsListener`.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Hands-on examples for sending and receiving messages.
- **Reliable Testing**: Integration tests using **Testcontainers** to emulate real-world behavior.
- **Cost-Effective Development**: Utilize **LocalStack** to simulate Amazon SQS in a local environment.
